1. Describe your person and your motivation to do this course.

  ðŸ˜„ I am taking this course because, first, I want to study a basic Python course to have at least a minimal understanding of coding. Second, I want to refresh my knowledge and skills in working with dataâ€”how to analyze, process, and implement it.
Third, I like this course because it includes practical tasks, homework assignments, a lot of reading materials, and video lessons. This also helps me learn different software programs.
Additionally, I plan to work in the IT field or data analytics in the future, and I believe that a design course is an important step in this direction. I also enjoy learning new things, and I attend this course with great enthusiasm. 

2. Describe your current computer experience

  ðŸ˜„ I have experience working with computers. I use a computer daily in my life. Previously, I worked in marketing as an advertising manager, which gave me a strong familiarity with computers. I created and managed content on Instagram and other social media platforms. I conducted market analysis, visualized sales data, and planned marketing strategies. Additionally, I organized workflows, set goals and plans, managed work records, and worked with databases. I am also familiar with Excel, Word, and presentation tools. This is my experience working with computers.
